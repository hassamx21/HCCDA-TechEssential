### This is a mini banking app project using python. The `banking_app` is a Python package with three modules: `bankcore.py` for user registration and login (using `branch_id` 2057 and unique `customer_id`s like `2057-1`), `accounts.py` for managing balances and transactions (check balance, deposit, withdraw), and `main.py` for the user interface. Run it by navigating to the directory in Command Prompt (`cd C:\Users\user\Downloads\banking_app`) and typing `python main.py`. It handles user authentication and transactions with error checking, storing data in memory during the session.
